# ðŸ“ˆ Cryptocurrency Anomaly Detection 

This project applies **unsupervised machine learning models** to detect unusual activities in cryptocurrency trading data. We use **Isolation Forest** and **DBSCAN** to identify anomalies in **price, trading volume, and market cap** that may indicate market manipulations or extreme fluctuations.

## Problem Statement  
Cryptocurrency markets experience frequent fluctuations, but some anomalies might indicate **unusual activities** such as pump-and-dump schemes, liquidity issues, or significant shifts in investor behavior.  
This project aims to **detect such anomalies using machine learning**, allowing traders and analysts to identify irregular patterns.

## Approach  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize **distributions** of price, volume, and market cap  
   - Detect **missing values** and perform data cleaning  
   - Analyze **correlations** between different financial metrics  

2. **Feature Preprocessing**  
   - Select key numerical features (**Price, Market Cap, Volume, Percentage Change**)  
   - Apply **Min-Max Scaling** to normalize data  

3. **Anomaly Detection Models**  
   - **Isolation Forest**: Detects outliers based on how easily they can be isolated  
   - **DBSCAN**: Clusters normal data points and labels low-density points as anomalies  

4. **Results & Analysis**  
   - Compare **anomalies detected** by both models  
   - Export the results to `crypto_anomalies.csv`
